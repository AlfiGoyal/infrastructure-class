= DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure: Assignment 6

== Overview
This week we will enable auto scaling for a set of EC2 instances and
use EFS to share files on the instances.

Like the previous assignment, you may have to work through some of the detailed
steps to complete the requirements. If you get stuck on a step, do a little
research on the AWS documentation site or reach out to the class on Slack. Your
feedback will be incorporated into future versions of the assignment.

== Requirements

You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment.

== The assignment

Let's start scaling.

=== Create VPC

Each assignment in this course has been less prescriptive than the previous
and this assignment is no different. By now, you should understand how to configure
a VPC, subnets, routing tables, an internet gateway, an elastic load balancer, and
EC2 instances. You will create all of these components and more in this week's
assignment. Remember, you can always look back at previous assignments, class
recordings, or online AWS documentation if you get stuck on a step.

You will build a VPC and set of AWS services which conforms to the service
diagram below.

Start the assignment by creating a VPC named `productionVpc` in the `us-east`
region. The VPC will have two subnets:

  * `production-public-1` subnet located in the `us-east-1a` availability zone
  will use the 10.0.1.0/25 network.
  * `production-public-2` subnet located in the `us-east-1b` availability zone
  will use the 10.0.1.128/25 network.

=== Terminate server

The last step in the assignment is to terminate the EC2 instances, delete
the load balancer, and delete the VPC. I'll leave this as an exercise for you to
figure out how to complete. Remember, you will get billed for each hour these
services are running (or at least lose free credits).

== Submitting your assignment
I will review your published work on GitHub after the homework due date.
