IT\r\ninfrastructure deployment practices are rapidly changing as organizations build\r\n\"Infrastructure  as code\" and adopt cloud computing platforms. We will examine\r\nthe theory behind these modern practices and the real-world implementation\r\nchallenges faced by IT organizations.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n----------\r\n\r\n*   Understand how IT organizations are deploying modern infrastructure and\r\nhow to build \"Infrastructure as code\".\r\n\r\n*   Understand how to architect cloud-scale distributed systems and the key\r\ndesign patterns used to enhance scalability and reliability within these\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n*   Develop specific skills related to DevOps practices including source\r\ncontrol management, package management, and configuration management.\r\n\r\nLecture Schedule\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n| Week | Topic                                                                  |\r\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| 1    | Course Introduction, Source control, Git                               |\r\n| 2    | Linux fundamentals, Package management, Shell scripting                |\r\n| 3    | Infrastructure fundamentals, Virtualization, Distributed infrastructure design and operations                                                           |\r\n| 4    | Cloud computing, AWS, IAM, EC2, S3                                     |\r\n| 5    | Cloud computing, AWS, VPC, RDS, ELB                                    |\r\n| 6    | Cloud computing, AWS, Autoscaling, Cloud Watch, Route53, SQS, SNS, SES |\r\n| 7    | Midterm                                                                |\r\n| 8    | Distributed application architecture, Web services, REST/ JSON / YAML  |\r\n| 9    | Configuration management I                                             |\r\n| 10   | Configuration management II                                            |\r\n| 11   | Containers, Docker                                                     |\r\n| 12   | DevOps, Continuous integration & deployment, Jenkins                   |\r\n| 13   | Data center architecture                                               |\r\n| 14   | Final exam                                                             |\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis repository requires the [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) toolchain\r\nto convert AsciiDoc files into PDF files.\r\n\r\nThe `generate-pdfs.sh` script in the `/build` directory will create PDF\r\nversions of all AsciiDoc files located in the root directory.\r\n",
